excerpt: 'This work provides a comprehensive overview on mitigating hydrogen embrittlement in pipeline steels using gaseous additives. Gaseous inhibitors decelerate hydrogen adsorption kinetics and reduce hydrogen-accelerated crack growth by competing for surface adsorption. The effectiveness is influenced by the mechanical test type, H2 pressure, and inhibitor concentration.'

The work investigates the use of gaseous additives like oxygen and carbon monoxide to mitigate the risk of hydrogen embrittlement in pipeline steels. Gaseous inhibitors reduce hydrogen absorption by slowing down the adsorption kinetics of hydrogen gas. However, a continuous supply of these inhibitors is essential for sustained mitigation. The paper also delves into the surface chemistry of these inhibitors, highlighting their competitive interactions with hydrogen on clean iron surfaces.

The research was supported by the Energy Transition Fund via the HyFit and HySource projects in collaboration with Fluxys. The work also received support from FWO (post-doctoral fellow project number - 1248122N).

My key responsibilities included investigation, methodology, validation, visualization, and the writing of the original draft.
