excerpt: 'This work reviews hydrogen embrittlement risks in pipeline steels during hydrogen transport and explores mitigation using trace inhibitor gases like oxygen and carbon monoxide. It examines surface interactions, showing inhibitors slow hydrogen adsorption but cannot stop equilibrium absorption, requiring continuous supply. The study highlights how factors such as test type, pressure, and inhibitor concentration affect mitigation effectiveness.'

## Overview
Hydrogen transport in pipelines is critical for renewable energy transition, but **hydrogen embrittlement (HE)** poses a major risk by weakening steels. Adding trace gases (inhibitors) like **CO, O₂, and NH₃** can mitigate this effect.

## Mechanisms of HE
- **Adsorption → Dissociation → Absorption** of H₂ on steel surfaces.  
- Affected by microstructure, stress, and surface defects.  
- Leads to cracking, reduced ductility, and fracture toughness.

## Gaseous Inhibitors
### Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Competes with H₂ for adsorption sites, raising dissociation energy.
- Effectiveness depends on:
  - Concentration (better at higher ppm).
  - Loading frequency (lower frequency improves inhibition).
  - Gas pressure (higher pressure requires more CO).
  - Crosshead speed (too slow reduces effect).

### Oxygen (O₂)
- More electronegative than H₂ → strong inhibitor via surface passivation.
- Inhibits crack growth, especially at ≥10 vppm.
- Efficiency influenced by strain rate and test frequency.

### Ammonia (NH₃)
- Adsorbs effectively but decomposes to produce hydrogen.
- Works at certain conditions; less effective at low strain rates and high pressures.

## Other Gases
- **Effective:** N₂O, SO₂ (moderate).  
- **Ineffective/Minimal:** CO₂, CH₄, C₂H₂.  
- **Harmful:** Sulfur-based gases (e.g., CH₃SH, H₂S).

## Key Influencing Factors
- **Higher inhibitor concentration** → better mitigation.  
- **Lower loading frequency** → more time for inhibitor adsorption.  
- **Higher H₂ pressure** → requires more inhibitors.  
- **Lower crosshead speeds** → reduce inhibitor efficiency.

## Conclusions
- Gaseous inhibitors slow hydrogen adsorption but do not prevent equilibrium absorption.  
- Continuous supply of inhibitors is essential.  
- Techno-economic feasibility (compression costs, scaling) is a major barrier.  
- More experimental research is needed across conditions (temperature, pressure, gas mix).

## Key Responsibilities as First Author
### Literature Review & Knowledge Integration
Conducted an extensive review of hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms in pipeline steels, with a particular focus on gaseous inhibitors such as CO, O₂, and NH₃, synthesizing findings across surface science, materials engineering, and fracture mechanics.

### Research Design & Methodology Development
Structured the study framework by combining theoretical models (e.g., Density Functional Theory insights, Sievert’s law) with experimental validation strategies to analyze inhibitor efficiency under varying loading, frequency, and pressure conditions.

### Data Analysis & Critical Evaluation
Interpreted results from mechanical tests (fracture toughness, fatigue crack growth, J–∆a resistance curves) to assess the mitigation performance of different gaseous inhibitors. Identified key influencing factors such as gas concentration, crosshead speed, and hydrogen pressure.

### Collaboration & Coordination
Coordinated with co-authors from Ghent University and Fluxys, integrating contributions across experimental work, computational modeling, and engineering applications. Ensured consistency in data interpretation and technical accuracy.

### Manuscript Preparation & Scientific Writing
Led the drafting of the manuscript, including abstract, introduction, mechanisms, results, and conclusions. Translated complex surface chemistry and materials science findings into clear, comprehensive narratives suitable for publication in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.

### Research Impact & Practical Implications
Highlighted techno-economic challenges of inhibitor use in large-scale hydrogen transport. Proposed future research directions involving varied conditions (temperature, hydrogen partial pressure, inhibitor mix) to optimize industrial applications.
