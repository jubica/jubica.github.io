ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Jubica, a doctoral researcher at Ghent University, specializing in the **impact of hydrogen on pipeline steels** to ensure the safety and reliability of hydrogen infrastructure. My work is a collaboration with [Fluxys](https://www.fluxys.com/) (a Belgian pipeline network operator) and the [Soete Laboratory](https://www.ugent.be/ea/emsme/en/research/soete).

Research Focus and Key Themes
======

My doctoral research investigates the impact of hydrogen on pipeline steels, with the goal of supporting material selection for safe hydrogen service. A key focus has been to establish a **screening methodology** by identifying critical material parameters that influence hydrogen sensitivity.

I have also worked on developing a **gaseous charging method** using autoclaves, focusing on the experimental parameters required for hydrogen uptake under static conditions. This work involved exploring the role of oxygen as a gaseous inhibitor to limit hydrogen absorption, with a focus on concentrations, temperatures, and pressures closer to real-world applications. Additionally, I studied the effects of **cathodic overprotection** that pipeline steels encounter in operational environments by investigating different charging current densities and analyzing cross-sections of various pipeline steel base materials. I also developed the **hydrogen microprint technique** in-house to study the preferential hydrogen sites in steels.

Technical Expertise and Methods
======

My expertise covers a range of advanced methods for materials and hydrogen characterization:

* **Microstructural Characterization:** Light Optical Microscopy (LOM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). I also integrated Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS) results from a collaboration with SCK to complement microstructural insights.
* **Hydrogen Characterization Techniques:** Electrochemical Hydrogen Permeation, Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS), electrochemical hydrogen charging, gaseous hydrogen charging setups, and the hydrogen microprinting technique.
* **Data Analysis & Interpretation:** I have quantified hydrogen diffusivity from permeation experiments, identified and characterized hydrogen trapping sites from TDS experiments, and simulated hydrogen uptake under targeted experimental conditions.

Academic Contributions and Recognition
======

Beyond my core research, I have guided one Masterâ€™s thesis and several Bachelorâ€™s thesis students. I have also assisted and collaborated with fellow PhD researchers and disseminated my findings through conferences and seminars to both industry and academia. My work was recognized as a finalist for the [**EGATEC Young Researchersâ€™ Awards 2024**](https://www.gerg.eu/the-2024-young-researchers-awards/) and selected as one of 27 outstanding papers for presentation at the [**Energy Pipeline Innovation Conference (EPIC25)**](https://epic25.eu/en/EPIC25).

Detailed Contributions
======

In my work, I was the primary contributor responsible for the investigation, methodology, validation, and visualization. I was also responsible for writing the original draft of the manuscript.
