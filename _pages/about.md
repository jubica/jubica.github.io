👋 Hi! I'm Jubica, a doctoral researcher at Ghent University, specializing in the **impact of hydrogen on pipeline steels** to ensure the safety and reliability of hydrogen infrastructure. My work is a collaboration with [Fluxys](https://www.fluxys.com/) (a Belgian pipeline network operator) and the [Soete Laboratory](https://www.ugent.be/ea/emsme/en/research/soete).

Research Focus 🎯 and Key Themes 🔑
======

* My doctoral research investigates the impact of hydrogen on pipeline steels to support material selection for safe hydrogen service.
* A key focus has been to establish a **screening methodology** by identifying critical material parameters that influence hydrogen sensitivity.
* I have developed a **gaseous charging method** using autoclaves to study hydrogen uptake under static conditions.
* I have also explored the role of oxygen as a gaseous inhibitor to limit hydrogen absorption, with a focus on concentrations, temperatures, and pressures closer to real-world applications.
* I have studied the effects of **cathodic overprotection** on pipeline steels by investigating different charging current densities.
* I have analyzed cross-sections of various pipeline steel base materials.
* I have developed the **hydrogen microprint technique** in-house to study the preferential hydrogen sites in steels.

Technical Expertise and Methods 🔧
======

My expertise covers a range of advanced methods for materials and hydrogen characterization:

* **Microstructural Characterization:** Light Optical Microscopy (LOM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). I also integrated Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy (PAS) results from a collaboration with SCK to complement microstructural insights.
* **Hydrogen Characterization Techniques:** Electrochemical Hydrogen Permeation, Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS), electrochemical hydrogen charging, gaseous hydrogen charging setups, and the hydrogen microprinting technique.
* **Data Analysis & Interpretation:** I have quantified hydrogen diffusivity from permeation experiments, identified and characterized hydrogen trapping sites from TDS experiments, and simulated hydrogen uptake under targeted experimental conditions.

*Finalist at EGATEC Young Researchers' Awards 2024*

Beyond my core research, I have guided one Master’s thesis and several Bachelor’s thesis students. I have also assisted and collaborated with fellow PhD researchers and disseminated my findings through conferences and seminars to both industry and academia. My work was recognized as a finalist for the [**EGATEC Young Researchers’ Awards 2024**](https://www.gerg.eu/the-2024-young-researchers-awards/) and selected as one of 27 outstanding papers for presentation at the [**Energy Pipeline Innovation Conference (EPIC25)**](https://epic25.eu/en/EPIC25).

Detailed Contributions 📝
======
In my work, I was the primary contributor responsible for the investigation, methodology, validation, and visualization. I was also responsible for writing the original draft of the manuscript.
